### Hi, I'm Abrar ðŸ‘‹  

#### About me:  
I am a senior undergraduate student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Rochester.
I am broadly interested in robotics and autonomous systems. This interest ranges throughout the 'robotics'
stack: from motion planning and state estimation to manipulation and human-robot interaction. I am currently a
research assistant at the [Robotics and Artifical Intelligence Laboratory](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/rail/index.html)
at the Uninversity of Rochester, looking at the use of probabilistic graphical models to infer distributions of
parametrized controllers for underactuated robots.
