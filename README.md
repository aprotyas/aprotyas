### Hi, I'm Abrar ðŸ‘‹  

*For recruiters: I'm looking for Summer 2021 internships in robotics, autonomous tech, electronics, and embedded systems.
[Link to my resume.](https://aprotyas.github.io/resources/resume.pdf)*  

I am a senior undergraduate student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Rochester.
I am broadly interested in robotics and autonomous systems. This interest ranges throughout the 'robotics'
stack: from motion planning and state estimation to manipulation and human-robot interaction. I have spent time
as an Applications Engineering Intern at Silicon Labs, and as a Research Fellow at the Wireless Communication
and Networking Group (WCNG).  

### Some tid-bits:  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning electrical and computer engineering, robotics, and autonomous systems.
